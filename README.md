# xv117s-brutal-doom-monster-expansion
A mod add-on for Doom that adds new foes to the demonic bestiary, brutalized through gore and other sprinkles of improvements, now unofficially updated through voluntary contribution since maybe the original user in charge has since dropped from this project or vanished without a trace.

DISCLAIMER: This is an open project for people to voluntarily contribute here, I do not own most of the things here. Most of the monsters seen here are from Realm667.

Spriters Credits: Ganbare-Lucifer, Craneo, Keeper, Vader, Amuscaria and even more people whose I don't know who made the sprites.

Coders Credits: Would be glad to know who coded the previous attempts.

Misc Credits: BLOODWOLF333, XV117, Pa1nk1ll3r & PB team, GameDude2, ProfessorExistential and more...

//ORIGINAL README//

// XV117's Monster Expansion for BDv21
// Fully Tested on Zandronum 3.0

Monster Expansion by XV117 modified by BLOODWOLF

Originally intended to provide compatibility with the DOOM Tribute Project 
and other Tormentor667 maps without losing the quality of the gore, it is 
designed to expand the spawn preset designated by BDv21 and includes 
a Random Spawner (separate) for use in normal maps such as 
extermination day, the vanilla maps of DOOM 1 and 2 or Final Doom or other
MegaWads.

With new AI enhacement for Z-Spec Ops and Release of the new 
"Monster Smart Reloading System" for all Zombified Monsters.

It can also be used in custom maps since it is set to be used in editors of 
worlds such as GZDOOM Builder or map generators such as OBLIGE.

Note: if you are going to use this in your custom maps do not attach it to your 
wad / pk3 since the constant updates of this add-on cause errors with previous 
versions, so do not do it to avoid complaints.

Current Version: Release v1.3.0
