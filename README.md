# xv117s-brutal-doom-monster-expansion
A mod add-on for Doom that adds new foes to the demonic bestiary, brutalized through gore and other sprinkles of improvements, now unofficially updated through voluntary contribution since maybe the original user in charge has since dropped from this project or vanished without a trace.

DISCLAIMER: This is an open project for people to voluntarily contribute here, I do not own most of the things here. Most of the monsters seen here are from Realm667.

Spriters Credits: Ganbare-Lucifer, Craneo, Keeper, Vader, and even more people whose I don't know who made the sprites.
Coders Credits: Would be glad to know who coded the previous attempts.
Misc Credits: BLOODWOLF333, XV117, Pa1nk1ll3r & PB team, GameDude2, ProfessorExistential and more...
